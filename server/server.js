BODY. This means that when we want to make a new 'todo' we're going to send a JSON Object over to the Server 
with a 'text' property, the server is going to take that 'text' property, create a new MODULE and send the
COMPLETE Module(with all the other property like '_id', 'completed' and so on) BACK to the client. To set up a
Route we need to cakk 'app.post()', the 'post' method take the URL as first argument and the Callback Function
as second argument that gets called with the 'req' and 'res' Objects. Now we need to GET the BODY Data that got
sent from the CLIENT and for doing this we have to use the 'body-parser' module we just downloaded, 'body-parser'
is going to take our JSON and CONVERT it into an Object ATTACHING it onto this 'req'(request) Object  */

    opening ourselves up to a more FLEXIBLE future, with THIS in place our SUCCESS case is good to go.
    Now if we run our application with the following code 'node .\server\server.js' and then we go on POSTMAN
    we can SEND a 'GET' request to this URL 'localhost:3000/todos' and we will see that we get back an EMPTY

  our UPDATES, so if we want to SET the 'text' of one of our 'todo' to something ELSE we would make a 'patch'
  REQUEST and we would set the 'text' property equal to WHATEVER we want this 'text' to BE. The problem here is
  that someone can send ANY property along, so they could send along properties that we DON'T want them to 
  UPDATE for example the 'completedAt' property that is going to be updated BUT not from the user, it's going to
  be updated by US when the user UPDATE the 'completed' property, 'completedAt' will be generated by the program
  which means we DON'T want that an user is able to update it. In order to pull off JUST the properties we want
  the user to update we're going to be using the '_.pick' method(coming from the 'lodash' library we just added) 
  that takes an OBJECT as FIRST parameter and an ARRAY of properties we WANT to pull off as SECOND argument IF
  they EXIST. For example IF the 'text' property EXIST we WANT to pull that off from 'req.body' and ADDING it to
  the 'body' variable because this is something that the user SHOULD be able to UPDATE and we'll do the SAME for
  the 'completed' property and THESE are the only two properties that the user is going to be able to UPDATE, we
  DON'T need the user to update other property like 'id' or ADDING any other properties that AREN'T specified in

    1st of the year 1970, so it's just a REGULAR Number where values GREATER than zero are milliseconds from
    THAT moment FORWARD and values LESS than zero are in the past, so if we had a number like -1000 it would be

  ALREADY generated the Object inside the 'body' variable above so we just set the '$set' OPERATOR to the 'body'
